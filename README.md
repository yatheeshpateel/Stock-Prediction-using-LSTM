# Stock-Prediction-using-LSTM
This is a Jupyter notebook project that uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict the stock price of any company.

# Installation
Before running this project, you will need to install the following packages:

pandas                                                                                                                                                                   
numpy                                                                                                                                                                   
matplotlib                                                                                                                                                               
sklearn                                                                                        
tensorflow   

                        
# You can install these packages by running the following command in your terminal:
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib sklearn tensorflow                                                                                   
  
  
 # Usage
 
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.                                                          
Open the Jupyter notebook file Stock_Prediction.ipynb in your Jupyter notebook application.                                                                               
In the first cell, replace the value of stock_symbol with the stock symbol of the company you want to predict the stock price for. For example, if you want to predict the stock price for Apple, set stock_symbol to AAPL.                                                                                   
Run the rest of the cells to train the LSTM model and predict the stock price.                                                                     
The last cell will output a plot of the predicted stock price along with the actual stock price (if available) for the last 30 days.

# Limitations                        
This project is for educational purposes only and is not intended for use in real-world financial decisions. The accuracy of the predicted stock price is not guaranteed and should be taken with a grain of salt.
